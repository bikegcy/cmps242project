word_dictionary_lr.py: The word dictionary generation python file for logistic regression.
word_dictionary.py: The word dictionary generation python file for naive bayes.
preprocess_yelp_dataset.py: Generate the training dataset and test dataset.
naive_bayes.py: Naive bayes classification python file and get the classification accuracy of training dataset and test dataset.
tfidf_feature.py: The features to generate tf * idf feature which you can use in Perception and Decision tree algorithms. 

1. Run the preprocess_yelp_dataset.py to generate the training dataset and test dataset.
2. Run the word_dictionary.py to generate positive words dictionary and negtive words dictionary.
3. Run the naive_bayes.py to get the classication accuracy of training dataset and test dataset. The performances of them are as following:
Accuracy of training set: 0.62955 (25182/40000)
Accuracy of test set: 0.6662 (6662/10000)
